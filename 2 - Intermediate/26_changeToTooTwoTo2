//Write a function that replaces 'two', 'too' and 'to' with the number '2'. Even if the sound is found mid word (like in octopus) or not in lowercase grandma still thinks that should be replaced with a 2. Bless her.

// 'I love to text' becomes 'I love 2 text'
// 'see you tomorrow' becomes 'see you 2morrow'
// 'look at that octopus' becomes 'look at that oc2pus'

function make2(str){
  // split string into an array of words
  let arr = str.split('');
  
  // loop through the array, checking for 'too', 'to', and 'two'
  for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
    if(arr[i] === 't' && arr[i+1] === 'o') {
      arr[i] = 2;
      arr[i+1] = ''
    }
  }
  
  return arr.join('');
}

console.log(make2('to'));
