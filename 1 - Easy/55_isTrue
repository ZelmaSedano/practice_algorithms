// when something is true, you don't have to to say inside the if statement ('if isLearning is true, do this'), you can simply pass it into the if statement and it'll run it like it said that
let isLearning = true;
if(isLearning){
    console.log("Keep it up!");
} else {
    console.log("Of course you're learning!");
}

// even though you don't say if(isLearning === true), it still evaluates to true, so you can skip passing that conditional into the if/else statement
